    "description": "This reference architecture demonstrates a flexible and secure multi-project environment designed to serve a centralized database to heterogeneous application consumers. The setup uses a Shared VPC model to provide a common, private network. A Cloud SQL instance (producer) is deployed in a dedicated service project and exposed securely via a single Private Service Connect (PSC) endpoint within the Shared VPC. This single database endpoint serves two distinct types of consumers located in another service project: a standalone GCE VM (suitable for specific tools or backend applications) and a Managed Instance Group (MIG), which provides a scalable and highly available application tier. Both consumer types connect to the database privately, with all traffic staying within Google's network. The configuration also simplifies operations by automatically provisioning a Cloud NAT gateway for internet egress and generating tag-based firewall rules to ensure both the VM and the MIG instances can securely access the database.
